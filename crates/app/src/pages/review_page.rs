//! A study session of one deck, or of the cards carrying a tag in every
//! deck that is not archived ([`Studied`], ADR 0069): the front, then the
//! back, then Fail or Pass; a summary at the end. Layout in
//! `data/review_page.blp` (ADR 0014).
//!
//! The order of cards is the core's [`Session`]. Each answer is recorded
//! at once with `record_review`, so leaving early loses nothing.
//!
//! A **practice** ([`Mode::Practice`], ADR 0070) runs on the same page over
//! the core's [`Practice`] instead: lowest retrievability first, the same
//! Fail and Pass, and **nothing written**. Its answers and their Undo go
//! only to the [`Practice`] in memory (`grade_practice`, `undo_practice`,
//! which call no writing method of [`AppState`]: the tests enforce it); a
//! banner says "Practice — nothing is rescheduled" and the summary
//! "Practice: nothing was rescheduled".
//! Edit, Card Information, Suspend, Move to Deck and Delete work as in a
//! session: explicit card commands, each with its own Undo, that do not
//! reschedule, so the summary stays true.
//!
//! Keys, in the bubble phase so a focused button keeps its own Space and
//! Enter: Space or Enter shows the answer; then 1 is Fail, 2 or Space is
//! Pass; E edits the card at any time; S suspends it and Delete deletes it
//! (after a question), both at once out of the session with an Undo toast
//! (ADR 0037); R plays the card's audio from its start (ADR 0056,
//! [`replay_target`]); Ctrl+Z (and the header's Undo button)
//! takes back the last answer, repeatedly down to the session's first, also
//! from the summary (ADR 0030). The focus rests on the card between answers.
//!
//! Editing opens the deck page's `CardEditor` on the card on screen. A
//! save re-renders the card in place (the state of the reveal, the timers
//! and the session are untouched); closing without saving changes nothing.
//! The page ignores its keys while the editor is open (`editing`), whatever
//! the dialog does with key events.
